Epitech Tower Defense like game

This project is a Tower Defense game. A Good example of this kind of games is Revenge of the titans.
Your main challenge for this game will be to create nice and smooth user interface and menus.

Your game must follow the following rules:
  •The player is a builder who must defend his castle,
  •Enemy waves will regularly appear from one side of the playground,
  •The player must buy and place buildings on the play-ground grid to block/kill enemies,
  •Buildings can be offensive (towers attacking) or defen-sive (basic walls),
  •When the castle is reached by an enemy, it takes dam-ages,
  •If the castle reaches 0 hit points the player loose.
  
Having a pleasant user interface is one of the details that makes a good quality game, this project is theoccasion for you to try your best on that topic.
